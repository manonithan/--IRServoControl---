IR Sensor Function
- Detects objects by emitting infrared light and measuring the reflection.
- When something comes close (within its detection range), the sensor sends a signal to the microcontroller.
-  Servo Motor Response
- The microcontroller receives the signal and activates the servo motor.
- The servo rotates to a specific angle (e.g., 90°) to perform a task—like opening a gate, moving a camera, or triggering a mechanism.
Real-World Uses
- Automatic doors: Servo opens when someone approaches.
- Obstacle-avoiding robots: Servo steers away from detected objects.
- Security systems: Servo triggers a camera or alarm when motion is detected.
