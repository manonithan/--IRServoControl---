# --IRServoControl---
An IR sensor detects nearby objects by emitting infrared light and sensing reflections. When an object is detected, it sends a signal to the microcontroller, which activates the servo motor. The servo then rotates to a set angle to perform tasks like opening gates or adjusting mechanisms.
